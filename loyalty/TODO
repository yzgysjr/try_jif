1. My implementation seems too awkward. I think there are too many downgradings in the code. I need to re-consider the labels deliberately and avoid some unnecessary endorsements / declassifications.
2. I have just implemented the six methods in the proposal. There is no main method, so I should implement it.
3. I have not write the README for this example. I will read it right after the first two problems are solved.
